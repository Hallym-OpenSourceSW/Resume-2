## COVER LETTER
　Contemplating about why I live and why I was born, I spent a lot of time trying to find my way and asking constantly myself what I want to do. After serving in the army, I attended working holiday program Australia for a year. I was in massage shop in Australia. With wage I earned, I enjoyed journey around the area. I especially loved driving and camp-firing with my friends and partners. I stayed in Philippines as well. and I stayed in Dublin, the capital of Ireland for about two years, from time to time spending my vacation in Paris, London, Barcelona and Firenze. Which broadened my perspectives and depended my view of the world. In total, I worked for about three years in a foreign country. With that income, I traveled around the world to meet many people and learned about life. It was great time experiencing various cultures.<br>
　A man made a filter with sensors for his child who had poor breathing, and other children who had poor breathing also got help. I heard about this story and got an answer which life is worthwhile. It is the most valuable life to help others with one's good abilities. So I came back to school to learn the skills that I need to help others.<br>
　My talent is in engineering. Unlike other students and engineers, I gained my real- life ideas on engineering from my experiences gained across different countries. I have roamed and returned. That leaves no regret at all. I had a dream of traveling around the world in my 20s. I am still developing my career path, but I am confident that I will not falter in my search anymore. My major is promising engineering. I think it is righteous to give back my knowledge and skills to society. I want to live life of sharing, using my talent for those who need the warm interest and opportunity of the world, and keeping my heart grateful for the valuable opportunities that society has given me to keep learning.
